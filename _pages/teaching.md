I'm an assistant professor in the UTM Biology department, with a large focus on teaching numerical and coding skills to biology undergraduate students.<br>
<h2>Active learning</h2>
One of the most effective form of learning in my opinion is learning through discovery, which is a foundational aspect of the constructivist framework. This is because advancing beyond introductory statistics and coding is a bit like learning how to ride a bike: it requires an understanding of concepts rather than memorization. This approach of teaching, however, has drawbacks when teaching in large classrooms at the undergraduate level. The major one is that progression through the topics and exercises becomes more difficult if a student misses 

<h2>Student evaluation of teaching</h2>
I believe student evaluation of teaching should only be used to assess the resource needs for teaching the desired curriculum, and that specific scores are not useful metrics of effective teaching. The reasons are several-fold.
<p>
1) Research has shown that teaching evaluations are mostly uncorrelated with actual learning, and that major contributors of teaching evaluation scores are discriminatory in nature. The reasons for this are not always obvious, but what is clear is that actions following the scores will lead to fewer women teaching at the University level with an even stronger impact on diversity and inclusitivity. 
    
2) Undergraduate students are not qualified to assess teaching in large-class settings because they perceive their point of view as universally applicable to the whole student population, and do not fully understand the impact of some actions on learning progress. Furthermore, there is an obvious conflict of interest whereby student evaluation of teaching scores are highly correlated with their grade in the course. This leads to teachers not covering part of the syllabus or the curriculum to decrease the load on students, to instructors teaching to the test because it makes the exams easy, to teachers not teaching 'unpopular' classes despite them being the most suitable for the task, and to more pervasively lead to grade inflation.
    
The troubling use of student evaluation of teaching has massive repercussions for effective learning. First, it is well established that active learning is a superior form of teaching, but that it almost always leads to students believe the teacher is less effective at teaching.
