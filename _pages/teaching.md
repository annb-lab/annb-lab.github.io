I'm an assistant professor in the UTM Biology department, with a large focus on teaching numerical and coding skills to biology undergraduate students.<br>
<h2>Active learning</h2>
One of the most effective form of learning in my opinion is learning through discovery, which is a foundational aspect of the constructivist framework. This is because advancing beyond introductory statistics and coding is a bit like learning how to ride a bike: it requires an understanding of concepts rather than memorization. This approach of teaching, however, has drawbacks when teaching in large classrooms at the undergraduate level. The major one is that progression through the topics and exercises becomes more difficult if a student has not been able to follow (due to any set of reasons), and that this sometimes becomes unsurmountable. Of course, the goal of the teacher is to find ways to identify shortcuts to understanding and apply them but when the course is highly streamlined, adequate learning is only possible with full student engagement and this is not always achievable. 

<h2>Student evaluation of teaching</h2>
I believe student evaluation of teaching should only be used to assess the resource needs for teaching the desired curriculum, and that specific scores are not useful metrics of effective teaching. The reasons are several-fold.<br>
<p>
1) Research has shown that teaching evaluations are mostly uncorrelated with actual learning, and that major contributors of teaching evaluation scores are discriminatory in nature. The reasons for this are not always obvious, but what is clear is that actions following the scores will lead to fewer women teaching at the University level with an even stronger impact on diversity and inclusitivity. 
<p>    
2) Undergraduate students are not qualified to assess teaching in large-class settings because they perceive their point of view as universally applicable to the whole student population, and do not fully understand the impact of some actions on learning progress. Furthermore, there is an obvious conflict of interest whereby student evaluation of teaching scores are highly correlated with their grade in the course. This leads to teachers not covering part of the syllabus or the curriculum to decrease the load on students, to instructors teaching to the test because it makes the exams easy, to teachers not teaching 'unpopular' classes despite them being the most suitable for the task, and to pervasive grade inflation.
<p>    
The troubling use of student evaluation of teaching has massive repercussions for effective learning. First, it is well established that active learning is a superior form of teaching, but that it almost always leads to students believing the teacher is less effective at teaching. Second, it is not an effective metric to gauge whether the students are learning better from year to year (again, it is largely unrelated to actual learning, and in many cases contrary to actual learning).
