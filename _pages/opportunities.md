<h2>Graduate/Undergraduate Students:</h2>
<p>
We are always on the lookout for talented students interested in exploring questions about evolution in well-controlled systems and quantitative genetics in all areas of life. Our team is using high-throughput experimental approaches to address these questions (for more on that, see our <a href="../research/">Research</a> page). 
</p><p>
Given the interdisciplinary nature of our work, students from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. biology, math, physics, computer science, and engineering) are encouraged to apply. 
If you are a prospective graduate student, you may join the lab by applying to the <a href="https://csb.utoronto.ca/graduate-studies/prospective-students/">Graduate Program in Cell and Systems Biology</a>. 
Our lab is also affiliated with the <a href="http://gbb.csb.utoronto.ca/">Genome Biology and Bioinformatics</a> program and students can participate in collaborative interships with the lab.
</p><p>
If you are interested in joining the lab, please contact Alex with a brief introduction about your background and research interest. 
</p>
<h2>Postdocs:</h2>
<p>
If you are potentially interested in a postdoc position in evolutionary dynamics, quantitative genetics, and synthetic biology (or, ideally, some combination of these) please email Alex Nguyen. Include a CV and a brief summary of your research interests and experience.
</p>
<h2>Commitments:</h2>
<p>
My lab is an open space and is committed to strengthening research excellence and society through equity, diversity and inclusion. Members of underrepresented groups are encouraged to reach out to Alex for opportunities.
