<h2>Interested in grad school?</h2>
<p>
We are always on the lookout for talented students interested in exploring questions about evolution in well-controlled systems and quantitative genetics in all areas of life. Our team is using high-throughput experimental approaches to address these questions (for more on that, see our <a href="../research/">Research</a> page). 
</p><p>
Given the interdisciplinary nature of our work, students from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. biology, math, physics, computer science, and engineering) are encouraged to apply. 
Our lab is also affiliated with the <a href="http://gbb.csb.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Genome Biology and Bioinformatics <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> program, as well as interfaces with <a href="https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">T-CAIREM <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, and students can participate in collaborative interships with the lab. If you are a prospective graduate student, you may join the lab by applying to the <a href="https://csb.utoronto.ca/graduate-studies/prospective-students/" target="_blank">Graduate Program in Cell and Systems Biology<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> in early winter and we strongly encourage you to contact your prospective supervisors well before the February deadline. 
</p><p>
  If you are interested in joining the lab, please <a href='../contact/'>contact</a> Alex with a brief introduction about your background and research interest.
</p>
<h2>Undergraduate research:</h2>
<p>
Highly motivated students with a desire to learn how we can couple cutting-edge genetics with computational analysis methods and machine learning for precision medicine and disease prevention may apply to gain class credit and work experience through the UTM ROP program (to be available soon!). Priority will be given to students displaying strong evidence of academic excellence, research potential and interpersonal skills. 
  </p><p>You can find more information on the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/experience/rop/" target="_blank">ROP program <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/asc/programs-and-workshops/program-accessing-research-training-part" target="_blank">PART training module <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> on the respective websites. Please <a href='../contact/'>contact</a> Alex with a brief introduction about your interests and a copy of your transcript. Preference is given to students traditionally underrepresented in these research areas.
</p>
<h2>Postdocs:</h2>
<p>
If you are potentially interested in a postdoc position in evolutionary dynamics, quantitative genetics, and synthetic biology (or, ideally, some combination of these) please email Alex Nguyen. Include a CV and a brief summary of your research interests and experience.
</p>
<h2>Commitments:</h2>
<p>
My lab is an open space, is accessible, and is committed to strengthening research excellence and society through equity, diversity and inclusion. We participate in active allyship and promote a culture of learning and understanding. Members of underrepresented groups, such as women in STEM, visible minorities, and LGBTQ, are encouraged to reach out to Alex for opportunities.
