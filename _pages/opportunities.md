<h2>Graduate/Undergraduate Students:</h2>
<p>
We are always on the lookout for talented students interested in exploring questions about evolution in well-controlled systems and quantitative genetics in all areas of life. Our team is using high-throughput experimental approaches to address these questions (for more on that, see our <a href="../research/">Research</a> page). 
</p><p>
Given the interdisciplinary nature of our work, students from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. biology, math, physics, computer science, and engineering) are encouraged to apply. 
Our lab is also affiliated with the <a href="http://gbb.csb.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Genome Biology and Bioinformatics <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> program and students can participate in collaborative interships with the lab. If you are a prospective graduate student, you may join the lab by applying to the <a href="https://csb.utoronto.ca/graduate-studies/prospective-students/" target="_blank">Graduate Program in Cell and Systems Biology<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> in late fall/early winter. Students completing their Masters degree wishing to enter the program directly into the PhD program should contact me as early as September and students entering into the Masters program (with options to transfer to the PhD program) should contact me before December to maximize potential for fellowships.<p>
Undergraduate students can join the lab for their fourth year project courses and our lab has one research position every summer. 
</p><p>
  If you are interested in joining the lab, please <a href='../contact/'>contact</a> Alex with a brief introduction about your background and research interest.
</p>
<h2>Postdocs:</h2>
<p>
If you are potentially interested in a postdoc position in evolutionary dynamics, quantitative genetics, and synthetic biology (or, ideally, some combination of these) please email Alex Nguyen. Include a CV and a brief summary of your research interests and experience.
</p>
<h2>Commitments:</h2>
<p>
My lab is an open space, is accessible, and is committed to strengthening research excellence and society through equity, diversity and inclusion. We participate in active allyship and promote a culture of learning and understanding. Members of underrepresented groups, such as women in STEM, visible minorities, and LGBTQ, are encouraged to reach out to Alex for opportunities.
